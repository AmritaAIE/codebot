## **Problem Statement**

This project aims to create a bird identification chatbot using a pre-trained deep learning model called VGG16 for image classification. 

We have taken the topic “Endangered Birds identification using Image recognition”. Bird identification can be a challenging task for bird enthusiasts, bird watchers, and researchers, especially for those who are new to birding. While there are many resources available for identifying birds, such as field guides and online databases, they can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. Therefore, there is a need for an accessible and user-friendly tool that can quickly and accurately identify birds.

To address this problem, we propose a bird identification chatbot that uses a pre-trained deep learning model called VGG16 for image classification and a large language model (LLM) for natural language processing. The chatbot will take bird images as input We have created a Chat-Bot which upon giving an image of bird as input gives the name and relevant information whatever we ask as an output. The goal is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool that can accurately identify birds and provide relevant information.





## **Abstract**

The chatbot takes bird images as input and gives the information whatever we ask. The chatbot is implemented using a large language model (LLM) to provide natural language processing capabilities. The VGG16 model is fine-tuned on a dataset of bird images to improve its accuracy in bird identification.

The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to bird enthusiasts of all levels. It uses a conversational interface to interact with users and provide information on bird identification. The chatbot's output includes the bird's common name, scientific name, and characteristics such as habitat, behavior, and diet. The VGG16 model's accuracy is tested on a validation dataset to ensure its reliability.

Overall, this project demonstrates the feasibility of using a pre-trained deep learning model in combination with a large language model to create a bird identification chatbot. The chatbot can be a useful tool for bird enthusiasts, bird watchers, and researchers interested in identifying birds quickly and accurately.

**Prompt** 

<b>We have given 2 prompts where the 1<sup>st</sup> prompt generates a brief overview for the model. The other prompt helps in chatting with the AI bot which answers the queries raised by the user which takes two inputs: input from the user and the previous history.</b>

**Short Description**

The proposed bird identification chatbot is a tool designed to quickly and accurately identify birds from an input image and provide relevant information about the bird's characteristics. The chatbot uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for image classification and a large language model (LLM) for natural language processing. The VGG16 model classifies the bird image and outputs the bird's name, which is then used by the LLM to generate a conversational response that includes the bird's characteristics such as habitat, behavior, and diet. The chatbot is user-friendly and accessible to bird enthusiasts of all levels. The block schematic demonstrates the integration of image classification and natural language processing to create a bird identification chatbot that is accurate, efficient, and user-friendly.

**Possible Future Extensions**


Improved Image Classification: The chatbot's accuracy can be further improved by using a more advanced image classification model or by fine-tuning the existing model on a larger dataset of bird images.

Multi-Language Support: The chatbot can be extended to support multiple languages to cater to a wider audience of bird enthusiasts across the world.

User Feedback and Training: The chatbot can be enhanced by incorporating user feedback to improve its accuracy and usability. The user feedback can be used to train the VGG16 model and fine-tune the LLM to provide better responses.

Audio Recognition: The chatbot can be extended to recognize bird sounds or calls to aid in bird identification.

Integration with Social Media: The chatbot can be integrated with social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram to allow users to share their bird sightings and obtain identification and information in real-time.

Augmented Reality: The chatbot can be extended to include an augmented reality feature that uses the smartphone camera to display bird information in real-time as the user points the camera towards the bird.
